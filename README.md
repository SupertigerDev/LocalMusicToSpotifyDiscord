# LocalMusicToSpotifyDiscord
Show what local music your playing in Discord using Spotify.  
Note: This was just a rushed project. It uses some hacky ways to make this work. Don't scream after looking at the code D:

# Requirements:
• Windows 10  
• Discord (ofc)  
• Spotify account  
• Discord linked with your Spotify account  

# Spotify secret and id
To create an secret and an ID, go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/, create a new app.

# How to use
EDIT: these instructions wont work as you need to provide a secret.
1. Login to Spotify in a browser
2. Extract the zip below and open the "OpenAny.html" and "openAnyOwo.exe"
3. Play a music using Groove music.
4. You will get a popup block alert in the website. Allow the popup and reload the page.
5. A new Spotify tab will open. Mute that tab.

Boom, if you followed all these steps, you should have your music showing in discord.
